# Project-2025

## 🔥 Overview
**Project-2025** is a collaborative, modular, and scalable initiative where Susheel (Project Lead), Shivam, and Himansu will build a series of **full-stack (frontend + backend)** projects — from small prototypes to large-scale applications.

Each project will live inside its own sub-folder within this repository.  
Once a project is completed, it will be archived or moved to a separate repository, and a new project will be started in this folder following the same structure.

This repository promotes teamwork, clean coding practices, and an easy contributing workflow.
